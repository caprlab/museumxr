    <p>This repository contains examples of, and student projects using, extended reality (XR) displays of museum artifacts. The two types of displays are pictures of artifacts and 360-degree image photospheres. The displays are presented in XR using the <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame java script library</a>.</p>
      <p>This is being used as an educational project for a cyberpsychology course.</p>

            <td><p>The artifact is a helmet mask that is made out of wood It has antelope horns, warthog tusks, and a hyena mouth. It was created by the Senufo people who are considered traditional people living between the Western Sudan region and the Guinea coast where the artifact also originated.</p>
              <p>The helmet mask is known as the Firespitter or Kponyungo. The name Kponyungo is derived from the words “Kpoo” and “Nyungo” which translate to “the head of a deceased one”. The mask is said to represent the chaotic state of things in ancient times. The artifact is worn during funeral ceremonies to honor the dead and ward off evil spirits. It is also worn during the carving of a hornbill which is a ceremony known as Porpianong. Porpianong is believed to be the mythological founder of the Senufo people.</p></td>

            <td>The Gbetu Wooden Mask Gola artifact originated from Grand Cape Mount or Lofa County, Liberia. Gbetu is a men’s masquerade performance for entertainment. Each mask is made of wood and raffia. A helmet-shaped wooden mask covered by a long ringed neck with a small head top.  Gbetu dances advanced in broad swishing movements, making full use of the head-to-toe raffia covering. The Gbetu itself is seen as a feminine figure. During performances, the mask figuratively gives birth to dancing figures that emerge from under its skirt, then retreats after the performance is over. Each mask is owned, controlled, and performed by specific households. Gbetu dances require stamina and flexibility.</td>

            <td>This is an oil painting of a woman holding a colorful variety of flowers inside a vase. The woman has long, wavy, and flowy hair running down her body. The cultural significance of this painting is that during the time of the painting African American women were his main ideas of painting. He highlighted ordinary women he encountered during his travels in Mexico. </td>

            <td><p>This artifact is a painting of a black woman with her arm around a vase of flowers on a broad canvas. The colorful flowers stand out amongst her flowing black hair on a light blue background. While all her body parts are elongated, her neck and chest are slender compared to her arm. New Orleans native William Pajaud created this painting in 1973. This piece of artwork was inspired by ordinary women he came across during his trip to Mexico.</p>
              <p>Mujeres Series #1 portrays a woman of beauty, femininity, and serenity. Since Pajaud decided to shift his artwork to reflect the injustices many people of color faced in Los Angeles, I believe he intended to depict a woman of color merely existing, reminding the observers and audience that they are still people.</p></td>
