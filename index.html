    <h2>museumxr</h2>
    <p>This repository contains examples of extended reality (XR) displays of museum artifacts. The two types of displays are pictures of artifacts and 360-degree image photospheres. The displays are presented in XR using the A-Frame java script library.</p>
    <p>This is being used as an educational project for a cyberpsychology course.</p>
