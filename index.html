    <h1>museumxr</h1>
    <p>This repository contains examples of, and student projects using, extended reality (XR) displays of museum artifacts. The two types of displays are pictures of artifacts and 360-degree image photospheres. The displays are presented in XR using the <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame java script library</a>.</p>
      <p>This is being used as an educational project for a cyberpsychology course.</p>

            <td><p>The artifact is a helmet mask that is made out of wood It has antelope horns, warthog tusks, and a hyena mouth. It was created by the Senufo people who are considered traditional people living between the Western Sudan region and the Guinea coast where the artifact also originated.</p>
              <p>The helmet mask is known as the Firespitter or Kponyungo. The name Kponyungo is derived from the words “Kpoo” and “Nyungo” which translate to “the head of a deceased one”. The mask is said to represent the chaotic state of things in ancient times. The artifact is worn during funeral ceremonies to honor the dead and ward off evil spirits. It is also worn during the carving of a hornbill which is a ceremony known as Porpianong. Porpianong is believed to be the mythological founder of the Senufo people.</p></td>
