# museumxr
This repository contains examples of extended reality (XR) displays of museum artifacts. The two types of displays are pictures of artifacts and 360-degree image photospheres. The displays are presented in XR using the A-Frame java script library.

This is being used as an educational project for a cyberpsychology course.
# Demos and Student Projects
Examples of each display as well as student created displays of artifacts can be found here: https://caprlab.github.io/museumxr/
